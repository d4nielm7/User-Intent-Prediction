:Load Data;
:Initialize Reader with Purchase History;
:Load Dataset with ID, ProductID_List, and Ratings;

partition "Parameter Tuning and Model Training" {
    :Define Parameter Grid for SVD Model;
    :Perform Grid Search with Cross-Validation (measures: RMSE, MAE);
    note right
        Grid Search is used to find optimal parameters for the SVD 
        model, tuning factors such as 'n_factors', 'n_epochs', 'lr_all', 
        and 'reg_all'.
    end note
    :Fit SVD Model with Best Parameters on Training Data;
}

partition "Cross-Validation and Evaluation" {
    :Perform Cross-Validation (5-fold) on Training Data;
    :Calculate Average RMSE and MAE across folds;
    note right
        Cross-validation helps in assessing model stability 
        and generalization by averaging metrics over multiple folds.
    end note
}

partition "Generate Recommendations" {
    :Predict Ratings for Test Data;
    :Store Predictions;
    note right
        Using the best-trained model, predictions are generated 
        for items in the test dataset based on user and item factors.
    end note
}

partition "Top-N Recommendations" {
    :Define Function to Extract Top N Recommendations for each User;
    :Sort Predictions by Rating for each User;
    :Select Top N Items;
    note right
        Extracting top-N recommendations involves sorting 
        predictions and selecting the highest-rated items.
    end note
}

partition "Output Recommendations" {
    :Merge Top-N Items with Product Information (Name, etc.);
    :Format Results with Predicted Ratings;
    :Return Top-N Recommended Items for each User;
    note right
        The final output provides the user with a list of recommended items, 
        including product names and predicted ratings for better insight.
    end note
