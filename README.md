# User-Intent-Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a recommendation system that leverages various machine learning models to enhance user intent prediction in an e-commerce setting. The project is divided into multiple steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, collaborative-based filtering, content-based filtering, and a hybrid recommendation model.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Cleaning**: Scripts for cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Visualization and statistical summaries to understand the dataset and uncover patterns.

3. **Clustering**: Performs clustering on the dataset to group users based on behavior, improving collaborative filtering by grouping similar users.

4. **Collaborative-Based Filtering**: Implements collaborative filtering techniques for personalized recommendations based on user-item interactions.

5. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items based on attributes such as descriptions, tags, and categories.

6. **Hybrid Model**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering approaches to improve recommendation accuracy.

- **Dataset**: Contains the dataset used for model training and testing. The data needs preprocessing via the scripts in Data Cleaning.

- **Diagram**: Diagrams explaining the project workflow, architecture, and model pipelines.

## Results
- **Collaborative-Based Filtering**: Provides recommendations based on user similarity and past interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items by matching item attributes to user preferences.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy and handle cold-start problems.

## Diagrams
Refer to the Diagram folder for visuals explaining the architecture and flow of the recommendation system.
